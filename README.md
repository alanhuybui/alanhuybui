## Hi, I'm Alan.

I'm a B.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering student at UT Austin with a focus on Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems.

I am primarily interested in RTL design and verification, specifically with FPGAs for aerospace applications.

I have experience in Verilog, Python, C, C++, and the Xilinx FPGA toolchain.
