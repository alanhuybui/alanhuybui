## Hi, I'm Alan.

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at UT Austin with a focus on Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems.

I am primarily interested in RTL design and verification, specifically with FPGA/ASIC for both aerospace or high-performance computing applications.

I have experience in Verilog and the Xilinx FPGA toolchain.

I invite you to explore my selected projects below:
